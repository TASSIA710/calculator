# Calc

A mathematical sandbox. WIP.



## Abstract

This project tries to eliminate standard floating point numbers for scientific computation
and replaces all numbers with either integers, fractions, or irrational constants.
This gives the best accuracy when dealing with functions, however you can always convert a value back to a simple double.



## Specifications

1. **0<sup>0</sup>** is defined as `1` in this environment.
